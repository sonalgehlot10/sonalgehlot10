### 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at the **University of Southern California**, passionate about building **intelligent, scalable, and user-centric systems**.  
My work bridges **software engineering** and **applied AI** from developing **full-stack web platforms** with authentication and deployment pipelines to experimenting with **deep learning models** for real-world problems.

I’ve built and deployed production-ready applications integrating **OpenAI APIs, Firebase, MongoDB, and Auth0**, used by hundreds of users. My interests lie in **AI-powered systems**, **distributed backend architectures**, and **developer tools that enhance productivity**.

I’m currently:
🧠 Exploring **Large Language Model (LLM) verification and alignment** as part of an applied NLP research project.  
⚙️ Enhancing full-stack scalability and cloud deployment skills.  
🧩 Practicing **Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design** for large-scale engineering roles.  

I aim to contribute to next-gen products at the intersection of **AI and software infrastructure**, building tools that are smart, efficient, and human-centered.
